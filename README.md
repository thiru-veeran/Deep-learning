# Deep-learning
gradient_descent_algorithms.ipynb we will anlayze the working mechanism of Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Momentum Based,Adagrad, Rmsprop etc.
In DeepCnn.ipynb we will classify cifar-10 datset using pretrained models. We will see how to customize the layers of pretrained models according to our dataset etc using pytorch.
